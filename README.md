react-navigation-codegen
========================

![Node CI](https://github.com/gas-buddy/react-navigation-codegen/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)

A simple code generator to turn concise YAML files into TypeScript code with information about your full navigation
stack in a React Navigation based app. This avoids lots of magic strings in your code, gives you a sense of the actual
navigation structure, and avoids repeating yourself in code as much as usual.
